Installing FEIDIAN

FEIDIAN requires PHP in order to function. You can download PHP for free from
http://www.php.net/. Download the zip of Windows Binaries and extract it to
C:\PHP\. I am not including instructions for installing PHP on FreeBSD/Linux
because if you use either of those OS'es, you better damn well know how
already, or at least be able to figure it out.

Once the zip is extracted, open up the folder. Copy php.ini-dist to C:\Windows
and rename it to php.ini. Then open the \dlls\ folder, select all the files and
copy them to C:\Windows\System32 (or C:\Windows\System if you're on 98).

Next, you should add PHP to your path. On Windows 2000/XP, right click
My Computer, pick Properties. Click the Advanced Tab then click the
Environment Variables command button. In the second window, there will be an
option for PATH. Double click it. Add to the end of the existing text:

  ;C:\PHP

Hit OK, you're all done.

If you're on Windows 98, the PATH is determined by your AUTOEXEC.BAT. Open it
in notepad and look for the PATH= line. Add the above text to the end of that
line, save, and reboot your computer.

Congratulations, PHP is installed!

If you're a Linux/FreeBSD user, feidian.php already includes the shell script
call to use the PHP interpreter. Just CHMOD it 755 and run it as ./feidian.php.

For Windows users, you will need to call PHP manually. This just means typing:
"php feidian.php" and then your arguments.
